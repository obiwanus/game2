TODO:

- Pass input to egui and make it work
- Figure out why the UI is dark
    - Check egui_glium example in renderdoc and compare the colors
    - If the colors in buffers are the same then it must be blending
- Consider using a heightmap
    - Get an example heightmap
    - How to build vertices from it? Using a shader?
- Use a proper brush
- Add an acceleration structure for faster picking
- Figure out the next steps (splatmap etc)

DONE:

25 Jul 2021, Sun
- Draw the UI (but it's very dark)
- Add proper blending
    + Read about blending
    + Read about premultiplied alpha
    + Enable it only for gui
+ Disable depth-stencil buffer for gui

24 Jul 2021, Sat
- Verified that the program crashes on glTexImage2D
- Load the texture properly

23 Jul 2021, Fri
- Debugging gui

22 Jul 2021, Thu
