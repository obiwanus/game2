TODO:

- Shape the heightmap using the simple brush
    - Check what are the options on modifying the buffer directly on the GPU
    - Consider splitting the terrain into smaller chunks so that we have smaller heightmaps
- Optimise the terrain tessellation
- Add lighting and shadows
- Figure out the next steps (splatmap etc)
- Steal code from the egui integration

DONE:

19 Aug 2021, Thu
- Load the heightmap with a 16 bit precision
- Raise and lower the terrain
    - Load a brush
    - Show the brush in the cursor

18 Aug 2021, Wed
+ Finish ray/heightmap intersection
    + Draw points alongside ray again
    + Fix the sampling of the points
    + Make sure the sampling doesn't crash
+ Stop drawing rays and aabb
+ Use my own version of stb_image (do when loading brushes)
+ Make the ray/heightmap intersection more precise

17 Aug 2021, Tue
+ Check points near the edge to find discrepancies
+ Make sure terrain uses the right texture coordinates

16 Aug 2021, Mon
+ Check why the heightmap sampling is wrong
    + Remove unnnecessary debug lines
    + Draw a set of sampled points over the terrain

15 Aug 2021, Sun
+ A first attempt at ray marching
+ Draw a debug ray (with differently coloured points)
+ Fix debug rays

14 Aug 2021, Sat
- Find where a point is in the texture

13 Aug 2021, Fri
- Get the closest/farthest points of ray/aabb
- Find out why the AABB doesn't match the terrain precisely
- The gui is back

12 Aug 2021, Thu
- Understand the ray/aabb intersection algorithm

11 Aug 2021, Wed
- Add AABB
- Check intersection of cursor vs terrain's AABB

10 Aug 2021, Tue
- Rewrite buffers and buffer attributes using OpenGL 4.5
- Remove buffer/array abstractions

9 Aug 2021, Mon
- Draw a different checkerboard pattern
- Draw a cursor somewhere

8 Aug 2021, Sun
- Debugging skybox
- Add a proper default skybox

7 Aug 2021, Sat
- Trying to replace skybox
- Skybox works but is noticeable

6 Aug 2021, Fri
- Bumped OpenGL to 4.5 - we won't ship with OpenGL anyway

5 Aug 2021, Thu
- Load an existing heightmap as an option

4 Aug 2021, Wed
- Generate vertices for patches on the GPU
- Refactor shaders
- Get rid of vertex generation on CPU
- Add tessellation control shader

3 Aug 2021, Tue
- Change the shader so it uses the heightmap
- Draw on the heightmap texture (but it doesn't work)
- Draw using the stupid brush (sort of works)

2 Aug 2021, Mon
- Debug egui hover and submit a bug
- Only touch the scene if not over GUI
- Show pointer when over UI
- Don't show terrain cursor when over UI
- Resize brush using cursor only when cursor is visible
- Create an empty heightmap texture

1 Aug 2021, Sun
- Finish input simplification
- Define several game modes
- Fix camera rotation
- Fix camera movement
- Accept all printable characters in text input

31 Jul 2021, Sat
- Refactored so it compiled
- Support text entry

30 Jul 2021, Fri
- Refactor input into a raw input (WIP)

29 Jul 2021, Thu
- Use a separate shader for terrain

28 Jul 2021, Wed
- Finish reading about gamma
- Use sRGB-aware textures and sRGB framebuffer

27 Jul 2021, Tue
- Adjust things for macos
- Read about gamma correctness/sRGB

26 Jul 2021, Mon
- Pass input to egui and make it work
- Fix the gui screen rect
- Add scissor
- Add global GL error handler
- Figure out why the UI is dark
    + Check egui_glium example in renderdoc and compare the colors
    + If the colors in buffers are the same then it must be blending or shader
    + Try switching shader

25 Jul 2021, Sun
- Draw the UI (but it's very dark)
- Add proper blending
    + Read about blending
    + Read about premultiplied alpha
    + Enable it only for gui
+ Disable depth-stencil buffer for gui

24 Jul 2021, Sat
- Verified that the program crashes on glTexImage2D
- Load the texture properly

23 Jul 2021, Fri
- Debugging gui

22 Jul 2021, Thu
- Fix a problem with buffer deletion

21 Jul 2021, Wed
- impl drop for buffers/arrays
+ Read the code of the integration egui/glium
    + Understand "begin_frame"
    + Who renders shapes and how?

20 Jul 2021, Tue
- Fix the camera moved flag and still shape the terrain

19 Jul 2021, Mon
- Apply a checkerboard texture
- Add our own gl bindings
- Make sure the brush can't be set to 0 size
