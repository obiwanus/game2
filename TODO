TODO:

- Use a proper brush
- Use my own version of stb_image lib (do when loading brushes)
- Add lighting and shadows
- Add an acceleration structure for faster picking
- Figure out the next steps (splatmap etc)
- Steal code from the egui integration

DONE:

3 Aug 2021, Tue
- Change the shader so it uses the heightmap
- Draw on the heightmap texture (but it doesn't work)
- Draw using the stupid brush (sort of works)

2 Aug 2021, Mon
- Debug egui hover and submit a bug
- Only touch the scene if not over GUI
- Show pointer when over UI
- Don't show terrain cursor when over UI
- Resize brush using cursor only when cursor is visible
- Create an empty heightmap texture

1 Aug 2021, Sun
- Finish input simplification
- Define several game modes
- Fix camera rotation
- Fix camera movement
- Accept all printable characters in text input

31 Jul 2021, Sat
- Refactored so it compiled
- Support text entry

30 Jul 2021, Fri
- Refactor input into a raw input (WIP)

29 Jul 2021, Thu
- Use a separate shader for terrain

28 Jul 2021, Wed
- Finish reading about gamma
- Use sRGB-aware textures and sRGB framebuffer

27 Jul 2021, Tue
- Adjust things for macos
- Read about gamma correctness/sRGB

26 Jul 2021, Mon
- Pass input to egui and make it work
- Fix the gui screen rect
- Add scissor
- Add global GL error handler
- Figure out why the UI is dark
    + Check egui_glium example in renderdoc and compare the colors
    + If the colors in buffers are the same then it must be blending or shader
    + Try switching shader

25 Jul 2021, Sun
- Draw the UI (but it's very dark)
- Add proper blending
    + Read about blending
    + Read about premultiplied alpha
    + Enable it only for gui
+ Disable depth-stencil buffer for gui

24 Jul 2021, Sat
- Verified that the program crashes on glTexImage2D
- Load the texture properly

23 Jul 2021, Fri
- Debugging gui

22 Jul 2021, Thu
- Fix a problem with buffer deletion

21 Jul 2021, Wed
- impl drop for buffers/arrays
+ Read the code of the integration egui/glium
    + Understand "begin_frame"
    + Who renders shapes and how?

20 Jul 2021, Tue
- Fix the camera moved flag and still shape the terrain

19 Jul 2021, Mon
- Apply a checkerboard texture
- Add our own gl bindings
- Make sure the brush can't be set to 0 size
- Anisotropic filtering
- Add some shading

18 Jul 2021, Sun
- Use shader to highlight a circle around the cursor
- Add a basic brush struct
- Add some very basic shaping
- Change brush size
- Add ambient lighting and a directional light (didn't work well)

17 Jul 2021, Sat
- Highlight the triangle under cursor
- Use the right button to WASD around in editor mode
- Investigate the inconsistencies
- Fix the inaccuracy when camera has not moved
- Speed boost

15 Jul 2021, Thu
- Cast a ray through pixel

14 Jul 2021, Wed
- Make a green flat terrain
- Add a skybox around it
