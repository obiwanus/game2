TODO:

- Consider using a heightmap
    - Get an example heightmap
    - How to build vertices from it? Using a shader?
- Use a proper brush
- Add an acceleration structure for faster picking
- Figure out the next steps (splatmap etc)
- impl drop for buffers/arrays

DONE:

17 Jul 2021, Sat
- Highlight the triangle under cursor
- Use the right button to WASD around in editor mode
- Investigate the inconsistencies
